# Dance Photo Gallery

Drop your favorite dance shots in this folder and list them in `manifest.json` so the right-hand gallery can load them.

## How to add photos
1. Place JPG or PNG files in this `dance-photos` folder.
2. Update `manifest.json` to include each filename, for example:
   ```json
   {
     "photos": [
       "stage-freeze.jpg",
       "footwork-wave.png",
       "duet-lighttrails.jpg"
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Reload the site and toggle the `instagram` command to see them in the side gallery.
